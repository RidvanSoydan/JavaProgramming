Tasks:

    1. Write a program that can reverse any given string

      			String str = "Java"; ==> avaJ
      		 //			      0123

	2. Write a program that can return the sum of even numbers between 1 to 100

	3. Write a program that can return the sum of odd numbers between 1 to 100

	4. write a program that can calculate the sum of all numbers between 1 to any given number
            ex:
                input: 100
                output: 5050

                input: 50
                output: 1275


	5. Write a program that can return the factorial number of any given number

            Ex:
                input: 5
                output: 120

                	( because: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2* 1 = 120 )


    6. write a program that can retive the digits, letters and special characters from a string
            Ex:
                input:
                    mn@#123Ab!

                output:
                    letters: mnAb
                    digits: 123
                    special chars: @#!


    7. Write a program that can return the sum of digits from a  string
             Ex:
                 input: A1B2C3



	8. Write a program that can check if the given String is palindrome

			Ex:
				input:
					Level

				output:
					true


				input:
					Anna

				output:
					true

       9. .Write a program that can return the unique characters from a String

                      Ex:
                          input:
                              AABCCD

                          output:
                              BD

       10. Given an int n, print true if it is within 10 of 100 or 200.

           Note: Math.abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number.
