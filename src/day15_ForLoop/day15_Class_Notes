package name: day15_ForLoop

Warmup tasks:
	1. Write a program that asks user to enter a word. If the work starts with x, replace it with a.
                    Input:
                        xcodex
                    Output:
                        acodex

	2. Write a program that asks user to enter a word. and replace all the x or X with character a
                    Input:
                        xcodeX
                    Output:
                        acodea

	3. Write a program that asks user to enter first and last names, and then prints the full name in regular format (first character in upper case)

                    input:
                        firstName = "cyDEo"
                        lastName = "SCHOOL";

                    output:
                        Cydeo School



    Loops (Döngü) meaning == repeated cycle... repeated statement...

            ***Loop function in java, help us to repeat statement that we want to repeat...
            ***Instead of repeating by yourself, create a loop and put it inside the loop,
                it will repeat for you multiple times...

            • Loops check a condition. (boolean conditions)
            • If Condition returns true, a code block will run
            • The condition will be checked again
            • It repeats until condition returns false.



             • There are three types of loops:
                        1. For loop ==> Regular For Loop and For-In Loop

              for (initialization,                    condition,                  Iteration) { statement }
                   starting point of the for loop     ending point                (yineleme)

                     ***Runs the given code a specific number of times.
                     ***Initialization is the starting point of the loop. (can be any variable)
                     ***Condition is the ending point of the loop.
                     ***Iterator is responsible for making the condition false.

                        ==> If you know exact number of repeating you can use for loop, (Hello World , 10 times)
                            if not you dont know exact number you cannot use for loop...
                        ==> Because you need to specify the initialization and condition as the components of for loop...

                        ==> When for loop start execution, first it will execute initialization, then it checks the condition,
                            if condition false, loop gets terminated, (When the condition expression evaluates to false, loop stops running)
                            if condition true, statement within the loops body gets executed, as long as the condition is true
                        ==> Iterator makes the condition getting false
                            increases or decreases the initialization's value to be able to get condition false...
                            The Iteration gets executed after each iteration through the loop

                For Loop Flow
                1. The first time the loop is run, the variable is assigned by a value.
                2. Every time the loop is run, condition is checked
                3. Then the code inside loop (between curly brackets) gets executed
                4. When the statements in curly braces have finished, the iteration gets executed.

                        2. While loop
                        3. Do while loop


Tasks:
	1. print the following shape:

				* * * * * *
                * * * * * *
                * * * * * *
                * * * * * *
                * * * * * *
                * * * * * *
                * * * * * *
                * * * * * *


    2. Write a method which prints out the numbers from 1 to 100 but for numbers which are a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FINRA" instead of the number,  for numbers which are a multiple of 3, print "FIN" instead of the number and for numbers which are a multiple of 5, print "RA" instead of the number.

        ex:
            output:
                1 2 FIN 4 RA FIN 7 8 FIN RA 11 FIN 13 14 FINRA 16 17 FIN



    3. Write a program that can calculate the sum of all integers between 1 to 100



Tasks:
	1. Write a program that can reverse any given string

			String str = "Java"; ==> avaJ
		 //			      0123
