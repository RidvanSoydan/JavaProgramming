Scanner Class: used for getting user inputs

            needs to be imported from "java.util"

            syntax of import statement:

                    import package.class;

                    import java.util.Scanner;

            Declare:
                Scanner variableName = new Scanner(System.in);


    Scanner methods: //After using methods it will wait for input, methods determine What kind of input user can provide

        nextInt()
        nextDouble()
        nextBoolean()
        next()

        nextLine()
            if we are using nextLine() method after the other methods of scanner, we MUST provide one addition nextLine()

        close()

            Method Name              Description
            nextByte()               Returns input as a byte
            nextShort()              Returns input as a short
            nextInt()                Returns input as an int
            nextLong ()              Returns input as a long
            nextFloat()              Returns input as a float

            nextBoolean()            Returns input as a boolean
            next()                   Returns input as a String, (reads the input only until a space)
            nextLine()               Returns input as a String, (reads the entire input until the new line (press enter))
