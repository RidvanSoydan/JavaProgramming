Java Day33

Package name: day33_Statics

Topic:  1. Creating Multiple class in a file

            class Student { // default access modifier
            }
                                            *** There can be just one "public" class inside file
                                            *** As many as classes can be created inside a file

            public class StudentTask { // public access modifier
            }                          // public class name must match with file name, rest of them cant be public

  *** While sharing two or more custom class codes in Discord, create a class under src folder => one public, others default

		2. Statics
			- Variables
			- Methods
			- static import

Warmup tasks:

	Student Task:

		1. Create a class called Student:

				Attributes:
				name, gender, age, studentID, grade

				Add a constructor that allows user to create object by setting the name of student

				Add a constructor that allows user to create object by setting the name and gender of the student

				Add a constructor that allows user to create object by setting the name and studentID of the student

				Add a constructor that allows user to create object by setting the name, studentID and grade of the student

				Add a constructor that allows user to create object by setting the name, gender and age of the student

				Add a constructor that allows user to create object by setting the name, gende, age and studentID of the student

				Add a constructor that allows user to create object by setting the name, gende, age, studentID and grade of the student

				Actions:
					toString()
					study()


instance    : belong to the object

		      each object has its own copy of the instances (can have multiple copies)


static      : belongs to the class, for common values...

		        • There is only one copy of statics that's shared by all objects of the class
                • Declared with static keyword
                • Belongs to the class and can be called through the class
                • All the objects of the class shares the same copy

Statics members  :

                Static is applicable for the following:S

                • Variables
                • Methods
                • Blocks
                • Class

        1. Static Variables

                • Refer to the common property of all objects
                • It gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading
                • A single copy of a class ‘s static variable is shared by all objects of the class
                • If changes are made to static variables, all other instances will see the effect of the change

                public class Circle {
                    public double radius;
                    public static double pi = 3,14;
                }

                public class CydeoStudent {
                     public String name;
                     public int age;
                     public static String schoolName = "Cydeo School";

                }

        2. Static Methods

                • If we declare any methods as static, it’s known as static methods
         ****   • A method that can be called using class name, without creating objects ****
                • Objects can also call static methods
         ****   • Static methods only accept static members  ****



         Static method                                      Instance method

         Static methods can not access instance             Instance methods can access instance
         methods and instance variables directly            methods and instance variables directly

         In static methods we can not use the “this”        Instance methods can also access static
         keyword                                            methods and static variables directly
