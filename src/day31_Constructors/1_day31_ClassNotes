	BankAccount Task:

	        Attributes:
	                1. accountHolder, 2. accountNumber, 3. balance

	        Actions:
	        	1. setInfo(): sets the accountHolder and accountNumber attributes
	        	2. toString()
	            3. checkBalance():displays the available balance

Constructor :

        • A special method that every class must have in java. (It is mandatory)
        • It’s used when we create objects of a class, without constructor object cannot be created
        • We can use constructors to initialize the object’s instance variables.
        • Execution of a constructor always depends on the object, no need to call like setInfo method.
          If you create object constructor get executed automatically
        • Constructor name must be same with class name.

        * Constructor is a special method that matches the name of the class
         and has no return type nor a specifier.

    Regular methods     :

		Access-Modifiers  Specifier  ReturnType methodName (Parameter){

	}

    Constructor syntax  :

		Access-Modifiers  ClassName (Parameter){

		}


Types of Constructors: No-Argument

        • A constructor that has no parameter.
        • Also known as default constructor.
        • If we do not define constructor is a class, then compiler creates default constructor

Types of Constructors: Parameterized

        • A constructor that has parameters.
        • If we want to initialize the fields (instance variables) of the class with our own values,
          then we pass parameters to the constructor
        • Better version of setInfo method
        • setInfo method must be called everytime manually, but constructor is being called automatically when the object created

Constructor Overloading

        • We can have multiple constructors in a class by implementing method overloading



Pizza Task:

    	Attributes:

    		size, numberofCheeseTopping, numberOfPepperoniTopping

    		Add a constructor that can set all the fields

		Actions:

			calcCost(): returns the totalCost of the pizza
			toString():returns a String containing the pizza size, quantity of each topping, and the pizza cost as calculated by calcCost()

		Pizza cost is determined by:

                        S: $10 + $2 per topping
                        M: $12 + $2 per topping
                        L: $14 + $2 per topping


Scrum Task:

	create a class called Tester

	        Attributes:
	            name, employeeID, JobTitle, Salary

	        Add A constructor that can set all the fields

	        Actions:
	           smokeTesting(),  creatingTicket(), dailyStandUp() toString()

	create a class called Developer

	          Attributes:
	            name, employeeID, JobTitle, Salary

	          Add A constructor that can set all the fileds

	          Actions:
	            coding(), unitTesting(), fixingBug(), toString()

	create a class called ScrumTeam

	           Attributes:
	                String PO, BA, SM;
	                ArrayList<Tester> testersList = new ArrayList<>();
	                ArrayList<Developer> devopsList = new ArrayList<>();
	                int daysOfSprint;

	               Add A constructor that can set the fileds PO, BA, and SM

	             Actions:
	                  addTester(Tester tester): adds the given tester to the testers ArrayList

	                  addTesters(Tester[] testers): adds the given testers to the testers ArrayList

	                  addDeveloper(Developer developer): adds the given developer to the developers ArrayList

	                  addDevelopers(Developer[] developers): adds the given developers to the developers ArrayList

	                  removeTester(long employeeID): removes the given tester from the testers ArrayList

	                  removeDeveloper(long employeeID): removes the developer from the developers ArrayList

	                  toString(): prints number of tester,& developers,  PO name, SM name, BA name


	create a class called MyScrumTeam:

	                    1. create an array of Testers and add the testers from your group
	                    2. create an array of developers add the developers from your group
	                    3. create an object of ScrumTeam and store the testers & developers above to the scrum team
