        Interview Question:
        Difference between final vs finally vs finalize.

            final   : is a KEYWORD for variables, methods, classes and make them unchangeable.

            finally : is a BLOCK. optional for try§catch (last block) in exception handling.
                     It always get executed, if we manually not terminate the program.

            finalize: is a METHOD that the garbage collector calls it to destroy the object.
                      It comes from Object class, and every object has finalize method.
