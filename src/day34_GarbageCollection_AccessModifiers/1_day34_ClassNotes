		3. Access Modifiers: public, private, default


package name: day34_GarbageCollection_AccessModifiers


static block: used for initializing static variables
			  gets executed as son as the class is loaded
			  runs first before everything, only runs one time
			  if the static variables need several steps to be initialized

                 • It’s a set of instructions that is run only once when a class is loaded into memory
                 • A static block is also called static initialization block

*** In java classes can be static but pre condition is there has to be nested classes
            Outer class can not be static, there is no way
            Inner class can be static


static import vs regular import

		regular import: imports everything from the class

			import packageName.className;
			import packageName.*;


		static import:

			import static packageName.className.staticMember;    // imports one static member of a class
			import static packageName.className.*;			     // imports all static members of a class


Garbage (Çöp) Collection: Collection of unreferenced (garbage) objects
                          To save memory

		unreferenced objects: Two ways

			1. null keyword:
					String str = "Java";
					str = null;         // Making unreferenced


			2. creating a new object

					String str = "Java";
					str = "Python";     // Now "Java" is unreferenced because we assigned str new value, old one is garbage


Garbage Collector: responsible for collecting the unreferenced objects from java heap and destroys it ( finalize())

        • JVM periodically runs a process known as the garbage collector, which
          removes unreferenced objects from memory
        • It is automatically done by the garbage collector (a part of JVM)
        • Only unreferenced objects will be chosen


Access Modifiers: define the accessibility

        • There are 4 access modifiers available in Java:

                * public
                * protected
                * default
                * private

        • A top level java class can have two access modifiers: public and default
        • Variables, Constructors and methods can have all four access modifiers


		public > protected > default > private

	    private: ONLY reachable within the same class, not open to others

	    default: ONLY reachable within the same package

	    public: ALWAYS reachable



            Access Modifiers         class   package     Subclass    World
            *public                   Yes      Yes          Yes       Yes
            *protected                Yes      Yes          Yes        No
            *default (no modifier)    Yes      Yes           No        No
            *private                  Yes       No           No        No
