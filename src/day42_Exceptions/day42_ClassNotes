Exception Handlings:

		1. try & catch: used for handling checked & unchecked exceptions

				try{
					exception code
				}catch(ExceptionType e){
					e.printStackTrace();
				}

		2. throws: used for handling checked exceptions ONLY

            • Used within the method signature
            • Informs the compiler that method throws one of the listed type exception
            • Fastest way to get rid of the compilation error that’s caused by a checked exception
            • Caller of the method will be responsible for handling the exception
              (Whoever calls the method that has throws keyword in its signature is responsible
               to handle it or declare it again)



throw keyword: used for manually throw exception

		throw ExceptionObject
