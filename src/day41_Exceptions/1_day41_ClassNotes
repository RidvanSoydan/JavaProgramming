Exceptions  :
        • An unwanted or unexpected event
        • Occurs during the compile time or during the runtime
        • There are two categories of exceptions: checked exception and unchecked exception
        • To prevent exceptions from crashing our program, we must write code that detects
          and handles them

Exceptions Topics   :
		1. Unchecked vs Checked
		2. try & catch blocks
		3. Multi-catch block
		4. finally block
		5. throws keyword
		6. throw keyword

Exceptions: unexpected or unwanted events

		Unchecked (unexpected event)    : occurs during the runtime

					all the RuntimeExceptions are unchecked exceptions

		checked (unwanted event)        : occurs during the compile time

					all the exceptions that are not RuntimeExceptions are checked exception


    Unchecked Exceptions
        • Exceptions that are not checked at compile time
        • Occurs DURING THE RUNTIME
        • Code will compile even if we do not handle them
        • They HAVE IS A relationship with RuntimeException class (parent class of all exceptions)

    checked Exceptions
        • Exceptions that are checked at compile time
        • Occurs DURING THE COMPILE TIME
        • Code will not compile even if we do not handle them
        • They DO NOT HAVE IS A relationship with RuntimeException class

    Errors
        • Indicates that an illegal operation is being performed
        • Occurs during the during the runtime only
        • They can not be recovered and not recommended to handle them


OutOfMemoryError: heap memory is full

Exception handlings :

		1. Try & Catch blocks: used for handling checked and unchecked exceptions

						try{

							exception code

						}catch(ExceptionClass  e){

							e.printStackTrace();

						}


			Multi-catch block: parent exception type can not be placed before the child exception type

			finally block: always gets executed regardless of the exception is being handled or not handled

							to stop the execution of the finally block: Syste.exit(0)


Interview Question:

		final vs finally vs finalize
