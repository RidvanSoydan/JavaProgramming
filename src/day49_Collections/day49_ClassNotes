When to use List, Set, and Queue?

    • List  : If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity where
              duplicates are allowed and insertion order preserved

    • Set   : If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity where
              duplicates are NOT allowed, and insertion order NOT preserved

    • Queue : If we want to represent a group of individual objects prior to processing
