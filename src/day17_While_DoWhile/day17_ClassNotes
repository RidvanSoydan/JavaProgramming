package name: day17_While_DoWHile

warmup tasks:
	1. Write a program that can return the frequency of a char from a String

			Ex:
				str = "AAABBBC"
				ch = 'A'

			Output:
				3


	2. write a program that can return the frequency of the a word Java from the sentence

        Ex:
            sentence = "JavaJavaJava";

            output: 3


           	Str = "JavaJava";

           		substrings:
           			1. Java  //substring(0, 4)
           			2. avaJ  //substring(1, 5)
           			3. vaJa  // substring(2, 2+4 )
           			4. aJav  // substring(3, 3+4)
           			5. Java  // substring(4, 4+4)



        	Str = "Java Java Java Python"

        		Delete 1st Java:
        				" Java Java Python"

				Delete 2d Java:
						" Java Python"

				Delete 3rd Java:
						"  Python"




while loop: repeated if statement   //Condition is checked at loop start // Loop gets terminated when condition is
                                       (Boolean)                            evaluated to false

	while(condition){
		statement;
	}


do -while : JUST DO IT

		do{
			statement;
		}while(condition);


    ****WHICH LOOP TO USE?

    • You can use a for loop, a while loop or a do-while loop, whichever is convenient.

    • A for-loop maybe used if the number of repetition is known in advance

    • A while loop may be used used if the number of repetition is not fixed

    • A do-while loop maybe used to replace while loop if the loop body must be
executed before the condition is checked.



branching statements:
			break statement: exits the loop & switch

			Loop{
			statement1;
			statement2
			break; //Jumps out of the loop, no matter how many cycles are left, loop is exited...
			statement3;
			statement4;
			}

			continue statement: skips the current iteration

            Loop{
			statement1;
			statement2
			continue;
			statement3; // These statements are skipped...
			statement4; // These statements are skipped...
			};





Task:
	1. Write a program for the  marriage proposal program asking the user, "Will you marry me?"
    if the answer is yes, print "Congrats."
    if the answer is no, print "Goodbye"
    if the answer is neither yes nor no, print "Invalid answer, please re-enter" and repeat it until the user enters either yes or no


    2. You are writing a code for the log-in function of the Cybertek Application, assume that your credentials are:
                    username: Cydeo
                    password: Cydeo123

        Ask the user to enter their credentials.
                If credentials are matched, your program should print "Logged in."
                If the credentials are not matched, the program should allow the user to have three attempts to enter correct credentials and if all three attempts are failed, then print "Your account is locked."



    	for(int i = 1; i <= 3; i++){

    		if(valid){
    			sout("Loged In")
    			break;
    		}

    		if( i==3){
    			sout(Your account is locked)
    		}

    	}
