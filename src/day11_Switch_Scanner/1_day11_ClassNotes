Warmup Tasks:

	1. Create a class called Browser. Write a program that can display the name of selected browser
	        1. declear a String variable named browserName
	        2. Assume that the valid browsers are: chrome, firefox, opera, safari, edge

If Statements SHort Quiz



Switch Statement: switch, case, default, break  //Close to Multi Branch If Statements
                                                //Anything could be done with switch statements
                                                  could be done with regular if statetements but reverse is not possible
                                                //But in some senarios switch statements is faster than regular if statements

    Switch-case statement used to compare the
    value of a variable with multiple values and
    execute some statements based on the match.


	syntax:
		switch(Data){                      //Data can be int, char and String...

			case data1:
					Statements;
					break;

			case data2:
					Statements;
					break;

			default:                //This is similar to else block of multi branch if statement
					Statements;
					break;

		}



	Case value MUST match with switch' data type and UNIQUE

	Switch' Data CAN NOT be long, float, double and boolean data types

	break: used for exiting the switch.
			if we don't give the break statement, switch statement continue
			to execute the next block(s) until the (break statement) or ( } ) of the switch

	default block gets executed if none of the case blocks matched.
			there can ONLY BE ONE default block

	or logic we can use it in switch by declaring case blocks back to back



Task:
	1. NameOfMonth  (1~12)
	2. NumberToWord (0~9)
	3. a char variable named grade is given. use switch statement to print the following messages:
			'A': excellent
			'B': great job
			'C': good
			'D': passed
			'F': failed
			other wise: invalid


	4. NumberOfDays
			28 Days: 2
			30 days: 4, 6, 9, 11
			31 days: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12

			If(1~12){


			}else{
				Invalid
			}
