method: grouping code fragments for one purpose ===> creating a function

			advantage: improves the re-usability of our codes


			                             MUST       MUST     MUST (Just Paranthesis)
		Access-Modifier   specifier   return-type   name  (Parameter) {

					code fragments
		}

		Acess modifier: public
				public: ALWAYS ACCESSIBLE

		Specifier: static
				static: method can be called through its class name


		ReturnType: void, any dataType
				void        : does not return a value
				any dataType: MUST return a value

		Parameter: any dataType (if the method needs additional info, if there is a information that function must have)

		Method Name: meaningful, descriptive


What's method?      ==> grouping code fragments for creating a function
                        improves the re-usability of our codes

What's void method? ==> Method just performs the task, it cannot return any value within the method...
                    ==> If there was any data you get within the method if you want to use it outside the method
                        it is not possible with void return type...

what's parameter?  ==> If there is a information that function must have...


What's return method? ==> Returning the value, if you want to use the data outside the method
                          we need to create return method, to be able to make the data reusable
                          if you can assign a variable it means that it is a value

return method: return type is not void
				MUST return a value

            **** The only difference between void and return methods, return method allows you to reuse the specific data
                  from the method by returning value (assigning method to a variable)
            **** If you want to reuse data you MUST use return method, if not void method can be used...

return statement    : 1) used for exiting the method
				      2) we can use it for returning a value from return methods


branching statements:

	continue        : skipping the current iteration

	break           : exits the loop or switch

	return          : exiting the method (one method, current method)
	              ==> You can use return method inside the void method but it won't return a value,
	                  just for exiting method...

	System.exit(0)  : exits the system (EVERYTHING WILL BE TERMINATED)




Task:
	1. create a method that can remove duplciated characters from a string and returns the new value
					"aaabbcccc" ===> "abc"

	2. create a method that can return the maximum number from an array of integers

	3. create a method that can return the minimum number from an array of integers

	4. create a method that return the reversed array
					{1,2,3,4,5} === > {5,4,3,2,1}


	5. create a method that can merge two arrays and returnj the new array
				arr1 = {1,2,3}
				arr2 = {4,5}

				{1,2,3,4,5}
