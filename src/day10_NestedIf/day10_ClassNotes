If Statements: used for conditional statements. if the condition true, the block gets executed

	single if: for one condition
				if(Condition)

	if & else: for 2 condition ONLY
	else{

	}

	multi-branch if: for 3 or more conditions
		else if(Condition)

	nested if: Pre-condition (öncelikli şart) (Most important condition, you have 8 conditions but all depends on one condition)
	 (something HAS TO BE MET FIRST in order for something happen)

        //Nested if statements can be used for creating a pre-condition
        //It’s used if one condition can be evaluated to several alternatives


Ternaries: shortcut of if statement
            It does the same thing with the if statement, just shortcut
            Ternaries can be used whenever the if block printing with same value and same data type

 	if          :        (Condition)?               (normally if (condition)        )
 	else        :                   :(colon)        (normally else { }              )
 	else if     :       :(Condition)?               (normally else if (condition)   )
